CipherLabs — Personal Website Project

A modern, minimalist personal website built to showcase my work as a cybersecurity researcher, developer, and builder of real-world tools.
This project is fully developed using Termux on Android, proving that real engineering isn’t about the device — it’s about consistency and creativity.

📌 Vision

Introduces who I am and what I do

Hosts long-form writeups, research notes & mini-blog posts

Becomes my digital home for the future
